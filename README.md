### Pursuing a PhD
- [Notes On The PhD Degree](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/essay.phd.html) **Douglas E. Comer** *Purdue University*
  - "These notes provide basic information about the purpose of a Ph.D. program in an attempt to help students decide whether to pursue a Ph.D. degree."

- [Everything I wanted to know about C.S. graduate school at the beginning but didn't learn until later.](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/PhD.html) **Ronald T. Azuma**
  - "A computer science graduate school survival guide, intended for prospective or novice graduate students. This guide describes what I wish I had known at the start of graduate school but had to learn the hard way instead. It focuses on mental toughness and the skills a graduate student needs. The guide also discusses finding a job after completing the Ph.D. and points to many other related web pages.""
- [Applying to Ph.D. Programs in Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) **Mor Harchol-Balter** *Carnegie Mellon University*
  - "This document is intended for people applying to Ph.D. programs in computer science or related areas. The document is informal in nature and is meant to express only the opinions of the author. The author is a professor of computer science at CMU, and has been involved in the Ph.D. admissions process at CMU, U.C. Berkeley, and MIT."
- [CS Grad School Series](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com.br/2008/08/cs-grad-school-part-1-deciding-to-apply.html) **Jean Yang, PhD Candidate** *MIT*
  - "As a result of talking to various people (/undergraduate seniors) who are figuring out what to do with their lives, I have made the arbitrary, unilateral decision that I will write a series of blog posts at you about how, why, where, etc. etc. etc. I applied to grad school."
- [So, you want to go to grad school?](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com.br/2010/09/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school.html) **Matt Welsh, Software Engineer at Google (previously a professor at Harvard** *Google/Harvard*
  - "Every year I am approached by students asking about grad school in Computer Science. I generally sit down with them for an hour or so and go over all of the details of why you should go, what the tradeoffs are, where you should apply, what it takes to get in, and so forth. I figured it would be a good idea to write some of this advice up in a blog post so I can capture it in a more permanent form. In this post, I will talk about why to do a PhD in Computer Science, and why not to do a PhD."

### About Science/Research
- [You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) **Richard Hamming** *Bell Communications Research*
  - Transcription of the Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar. "This talk centered on Hamming's observations and research on the question 'Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?'"
